# Day 2 – Captain Module (Driver Auth)

Welcome to **Day 2** of my **#100DaysOfCode** challenge! 🚀

## ✅ What I Did Today

- Created **Captain model** with:
  - Full name
  - Email & password
  - Vehicle details (color, plate, capacity, type)
  - Location & status
- Built secure **Captain registration**, **login**, **logout**, and **profile** routes.
- Implemented:
  - JWT-based authentication with 24h expiry
  - Token blacklisting on logout
  - Express Validator for input validation
- Added middleware for captain-specific authentication.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Captains can:
  - Register with vehicle details
  - Log in securely
  - Access their profile
  - Log out (and invalidate token)
- Passwords are hashed using **bcrypt**
- Tokens are securely handled using **cookies**

## 🔐 Captain Routes

| Method | Route         | Description                |
|--------|---------------|----------------------------|
| POST   | `/captain/register` | Register a new captain      |
| POST   | `/captain/login`    | Login existing captain      |
| GET    | `/captain/profile`  | Get captain's profile       |
| GET    | `/captain/logout`   | Logout the captain          |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- bcrypt for hashing
- JWT for authentication
- express-validator for validation
- Cookie-based session tokens

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Nested schema design for structured data (like vehicle info)
- Role-specific middleware (`authCaptain`)
- Server-side form validation
- Token management and logout security

📅 On to Day 3 tomorrow! Thinking about ride requests or captain location updates next.
# Day 3 – Location & Maps Integration (Uber Clone Backend)

**Day 3** of my #100DaysOfCode challenge is done ✅  
Today was all about integrating **location-based services** into the backend for my **Uber clone project**.

## 🌍 What I Built

Added core map functionality to power ride discovery, ETA calculations, and autocomplete during pickup/dropoff.

- Integrated **GoMaps API** (a free Google Maps-compatible alternative).
- Created a service layer to handle:
  - 📍 Converting addresses into coordinates
  - 🚗 Calculating distance & estimated travel time between two locations
  - 🔍 Autocomplete suggestions for locations during input
- Built secure **protected API routes** for these services.

## ✨ API Endpoints

| Method | Route                      | Description                             |
|--------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/map/get-coordinates`     | Get lat/lng from an address             |
| GET    | `/map/get-distance-time`   | Get distance & duration between points  |
| GET    | `/map/get-suggestion`      | Get autocomplete suggestions for input  |

> All endpoints require user authentication.

## 🔑 Example Query

**GET** `/map/get-coordinates?address=Addis Ababa`  
**Response:**

```json
{
  "lat": 8.9806,
  "lng": 38.7578
}
```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
-axios for API calls

-GoMaps API (Google Maps-compatible & free)

-express-validator for query validation

-Custom controller & service layers

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
-How to structure external API calls in a service layer

-Validating query parameters with express-validator

-Error handling best practices with external APIs

-Using alternatives to Google Maps that are cost-effective

🔥 Maps are now part of the project! On to Day 4 next. Thinking about implementing ride requests or driver discovery…


# Day 4 – Ride Management, Real-Time Updates & GPS Challenges (Uber Clone)

**Day 4** of my #100DaysOfCode is complete ✅  
Today I wrapped up the **ride management flow** for my **Uber clone backend**, including real-time socket updates, captain assignment, and trip tracking.

## 🛠️ What I Built

- 🚗 **Ride Request Flow**
  - Users can create ride requests with pickup, destination, and vehicle type.
  - Available captains are notified in real-time using Socket.io.
  
- 🧮 **Fare Estimation**
  - Built a fare calculator based on:
    - Base fare
    - Per km and per minute rates (customized by vehicle type)
    - Distance & duration via map service

- 📍 **Real-time Ride Lifecycle**
  - Confirming ride from captain side
  - Starting & ending rides with OTP verification
  - Periodic location updates (simulated via intervals)

- 🔒 All endpoints protected via **JWT-based authentication** (separate for users & captains)

## 🔁 Ride API Endpoints

| Method | Route             | Description                            |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/ride/create`    | User requests a ride                   |
| GET    | `/ride/get-fare`  | Get fare estimate for a trip           |
| POST   | `/ride/confirm`   | Captain confirms a ride                |
| GET    | `/ride/start-ride`| Start ride with OTP verification       |
| POST   | `/ride/end-ride`  | Mark a ride as completed               |

## 📡 Real-time Features (Socket.io)

- On ride request: Nearby captains receive a `new-ride` event
- On confirm/start/end ride: User gets live updates via `ride-confirmed`, `ride-started`, and `ride-ended` events
- Captain location updated periodically, throttled to once per minute to save bandwidth

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

Today I ran into an issue where **location updates weren’t accurate**, especially when testing on my device.  
Turns out: **My device doesn't support high-accuracy GPS**, so I was getting approximate locations via Wi-Fi/IP.  
**Lesson learned**: Always verify device GPS settings when testing geo features!

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- How to chain ride status transitions (pending → accepted → ongoing → completed)
- Structuring ride-related logic in clean service layers
- Using **express-validator** to keep requests safe and predictable
- Handling geo location edge cases in real-world testing

---

🎯 **Next Up (Day 5)**: I'm switching gears and starting the **client-side (mobile/web) app** for users to request and track rides! Excited to build out real-time UI with maps and socket updates.

Let’s gooo 🚀

# 🚀 Day 5: Building the Uber Clone (Frontend)


### ✅ What I Did Today

Today was all about building out the **user and captain authentication flow** in the frontend for my Uber Clone project. After setting up all necessary dependencies, I implemented the following key features using **React**:

---

### 👨‍💻 User Flow
- ✅ **User Signup** page  
- ✅ **User Login** page  
- ✅ **User Logout** functionality  
- ✅ Redirects based on auth token (user vs. captain)

---

### 🚖 Captain Flow
- ✅ **Captain Login** page  
- ✅ **Captain Logout** functionality  
- ✅ Separate home screen for Captain

---

### ⚙️ Tech Stack & Tools
- React + React Router DOM
- Axios for HTTP requests
- Tailwind CSS for UI styling
- Context API for global auth state management
- Lazy loading with `React.Suspense` for routes
- Loading screen component

---


### 🔍 Next Up
- Start designing the **Home** screens (for users and captains)
- Implement **ride booking flow**
- Add **map integrations** and **location tracking**

---

### 🧠 Reflection
Feeling good about today’s progress. Routing and auth handling are now solid foundations to build on. Separating flows for users and captains turned out cleaner than expected!
