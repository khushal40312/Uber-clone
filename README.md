# Day 1 – Backend Setup & User Authentication

Welcome to **Day 1** of my **#100DaysOfCode** journey! 🚀

## ✅ What I Did Today

- Initialized the backend project using **Node.js** and **Express**.
- Set up **user authentication** with:
  - **Registration**
  - **Login**
  - **Logout**
  - **Profile retrieval**
- Implemented **input validation** with `express-validator`.
- Used **JWT tokens** for secure authentication.
- Added **token blacklisting** for secure logout.

## 🔐 Routes Implemented

| Method | Route         | Description          |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| POST   | `/register`   | Register a new user  |
| POST   | `/login`      | Login existing user  |
| GET    | `/profile`    | Get user profile     |
| GET    | `/logout`     | Logout user          |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (Mongoose)
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Express Validator
- Cookies for token storage

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Middleware setup for auth checks
- Structuring Express routes and controllers
- Secure cookie handling and blacklisting tokens

# Day 2 – Captain Module (Driver Auth)

Welcome to **Day 2** of my **#100DaysOfCode** challenge! 🚀

## ✅ What I Did Today

- Created **Captain model** with:
  - Full name
  - Email & password
  - Vehicle details (color, plate, capacity, type)
  - Location & status
- Built secure **Captain registration**, **login**, **logout**, and **profile** routes.
- Implemented:
  - JWT-based authentication with 24h expiry
  - Token blacklisting on logout
  - Express Validator for input validation
- Added middleware for captain-specific authentication.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Captains can:
  - Register with vehicle details
  - Log in securely
  - Access their profile
  - Log out (and invalidate token)
- Passwords are hashed using **bcrypt**
- Tokens are securely handled using **cookies**

## 🔐 Captain Routes

| Method | Route         | Description                |
|--------|---------------|----------------------------|
| POST   | `/captain/register` | Register a new captain      |
| POST   | `/captain/login`    | Login existing captain      |
| GET    | `/captain/profile`  | Get captain's profile       |
| GET    | `/captain/logout`   | Logout the captain          |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- bcrypt for hashing
- JWT for authentication
- express-validator for validation
- Cookie-based session tokens

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Nested schema design for structured data (like vehicle info)
- Role-specific middleware (`authCaptain`)
- Server-side form validation
- Token management and logout security

📅 On to Day 3 tomorrow! Thinking about ride requests or captain location updates next.
# Day 3 – Location & Maps Integration (Uber Clone Backend)

**Day 3** of my #100DaysOfCode challenge is done ✅  
Today was all about integrating **location-based services** into the backend for my **Uber clone project**.

## 🌍 What I Built

Added core map functionality to power ride discovery, ETA calculations, and autocomplete during pickup/dropoff.

- Integrated **GoMaps API** (a free Google Maps-compatible alternative).
- Created a service layer to handle:
  - 📍 Converting addresses into coordinates
  - 🚗 Calculating distance & estimated travel time between two locations
  - 🔍 Autocomplete suggestions for locations during input
- Built secure **protected API routes** for these services.

## ✨ API Endpoints

| Method | Route                      | Description                             |
|--------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/map/get-coordinates`     | Get lat/lng from an address             |
| GET    | `/map/get-distance-time`   | Get distance & duration between points  |
| GET    | `/map/get-suggestion`      | Get autocomplete suggestions for input  |

> All endpoints require user authentication.

## 🔑 Example Query

**GET** `/map/get-coordinates?address=Addis Ababa`  
**Response:**

```json
{
  "lat": 8.9806,
  "lng": 38.7578
}
```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
-axios for API calls

-GoMaps API (Google Maps-compatible & free)

-express-validator for query validation

-Custom controller & service layers

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
-How to structure external API calls in a service layer

-Validating query parameters with express-validator

-Error handling best practices with external APIs

-Using alternatives to Google Maps that are cost-effective

🔥 Maps are now part of the project! On to Day 4 next. Thinking about implementing ride requests or driver discovery…
