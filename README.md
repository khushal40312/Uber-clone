# Day 3 – Location & Maps Integration (Uber Clone Backend)

**Day 3** of my #100DaysOfCode challenge is done ✅  
Today was all about integrating **location-based services** into the backend for my **Uber clone project**.

## 🌍 What I Built

Added core map functionality to power ride discovery, ETA calculations, and autocomplete during pickup/dropoff.

- Integrated **GoMaps API** (a free Google Maps-compatible alternative).
- Created a service layer to handle:
  - 📍 Converting addresses into coordinates
  - 🚗 Calculating distance & estimated travel time between two locations
  - 🔍 Autocomplete suggestions for locations during input
- Built secure **protected API routes** for these services.

## ✨ API Endpoints

| Method | Route                    | Description                            |
| ------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/map/get-coordinates`   | Get lat/lng from an address            |
| GET    | `/map/get-distance-time` | Get distance & duration between points |
| GET    | `/map/get-suggestion`    | Get autocomplete suggestions for input |

> All endpoints require user authentication.

## 🔑 Example Query

**GET** `/map/get-coordinates?address=Addis Ababa`  
**Response:**

```json
{
  "lat": 8.9806,
  "lng": 38.7578
}
```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-axios for API calls

-GoMaps API (Google Maps-compatible & free)

🔥 Maps are now part of the project! On to Day 4 next. Thinking about implementing ride requests or driver discovery…

# Day 4 – Ride Management, Real-Time Updates & GPS Challenges (Uber Clone)

**Day 4** of my #100DaysOfCode is complete ✅  
Today I wrapped up the **ride management flow** for my **Uber clone backend**, including real-time socket updates, captain assignment, and trip tracking.

## 🛠️ What I Built

- 🚗 **Ride Request Flow**
  - Users can create ride requests with pickup, destination, and vehicle type.
  - Available captains are notified in real-time using Socket.io.
- 🧮 **Fare Estimation**

  - Built a fare calculator based on:
    - Base fare
    - Per km and per minute rates (customized by vehicle type)
    - Distance & duration via map service

- 📍 **Real-time Ride Lifecycle**

  - Confirming ride from captain side
  - Starting & ending rides with OTP verification
  - Periodic location updates (simulated via intervals)

- 🔒 All endpoints protected via **JWT-based authentication** (separate for users & captains)

## 🔁 Ride API Endpoints

| Method | Route              | Description                      |
| ------ | ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/ride/create`     | User requests a ride             |
| GET    | `/ride/get-fare`   | Get fare estimate for a trip     |
| POST   | `/ride/confirm`    | Captain confirms a ride          |
| GET    | `/ride/start-ride` | Start ride with OTP verification |
| POST   | `/ride/end-ride`   | Mark a ride as completed         |

## 📡 Real-time Features (Socket.io)

- On ride request: Nearby captains receive a `new-ride` event
- On confirm/start/end ride: User gets live updates via `ride-confirmed`, `ride-started`, and `ride-ended` events
- Captain location updated periodically, throttled to once per minute to save bandwidth

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

Today I ran into an issue where **location updates weren’t accurate**, especially when testing on my device.  
Turns out: **My device doesn't support high-accuracy GPS**, so I was getting approximate locations via Wi-Fi/IP.  
**Lesson learned**: Always verify device GPS settings when testing geo features!

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- How to chain ride status transitions (pending → accepted → ongoing → completed)
- Structuring ride-related logic in clean service layers
- Using **express-validator** to keep requests safe and predictable
- Handling geo location edge cases in real-world testing

---

🎯 **Next Up (Day 5)**: I'm switching gears and starting the **client-side (mobile/web) app** for users to request and track rides! Excited to build out real-time UI with maps and socket updates.

🧘‍♂️ _Small wins, strong systems, sustainable progress._

# 🚧 Day 13 – Cross-Service Messaging & Auth Middleware Magic ✨

## 🧠 Today's Focus

Dove into **RabbitMQ integration** to enable **cross-service communication** and **decoupled architecture**. Also kicked off the **JWT Auth Middleware**, enabling secure user validation across services without tight coupling. The microservice transition is really taking shape now! 💪

---

## ✅ What I Did Today

- 📨 Integrated **RabbitMQ Cloud** (via `amqplib`) for internal service communication.
- 🔄 Set up **RPC-style request/reply** pattern for:

  - 🔍 `getCaptainNear(payload)` → triggered by ride service to fetch nearby captains.
  - 🔐 `getMiddleware(token)` → validates JWT token by sending it to user service via queue.

- 🧱 Abstracted middleware logic so the **API Gateway** can verify tokens asynchronously without needing direct DB access.

### 🔐 Auth Middleware Sample (via RabbitMQ)

```js
// gateway/middleware/auth.js
const getMiddleware = require('../rpc/getMiddleware');

module.exports = async function (req, res, next) {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(" ")[1];

  if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ error: "Unauthorized" });

  try {
    const user = await getMiddleware(token); // via RabbitMQ
    req.user = user;
    next();
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Auth error:", err);
    res.status(403).json({ error: "Forbidden" });
  }
};
🧹 Cleaned and modularized message queue logic.

🌐 Updated API Gateway routing to use new middleware.

💡 Takeaways
Microservices aren't just separate servers — they're independent minds working in sync.
Messaging queues = the nervous system. 🧠⚡

RabbitMQ unlocked true decoupling — services don’t need direct access to each other.

Middleware via messaging = smart gateway, minimal coupling.

Architecture is scaling smoothly with each service extracted.

---

🔮 Tomorrow's Goals (Day 14)
🧪 Expand JWT auth with role-based access (user, captain)

🧭 Finish captain service logic + DB models

🐳 Dockerize all services and gateway

🔗 Hook frontend with new API Gateway endpoints

🛤️ Microservice highway is open. Building traffic signals, not roadblocks.
Let’s keep pushing — sustainably and smart. 🧘‍♂️
```

# 🚧 Day 14 – RPC Listeners, Real-Time Updates & WebSocket Gateway Magic 🧙‍♂️✨

## 🧠 Today's Focus

Connected all the dots with **RabbitMQ-based RPC listeners**, enabling cross-service communication between **Users**, **Captains**, and **Rides**. Also set up **WebSocket proxying** in the API Gateway, powering real-time updates like socket ID changes and live captain location sharing. It's all talking to each other now — asynchronously, cleanly, and magically. 🛸

---

## ✅ What I Did Today

- 🔁 Created **RPC Listeners** to handle:
  - 🧭 `get_captain` → fetch captains near a geo-location.
  - 🧠 `get_user_rides` → fetch captain's past rides.
  - 🛰️ `get_captainSocketUpdate` → update captain socket ID or location.

- 📡 Built RPC Clients to request data from other services via queues:
  - `getCaptainRides(userId)`
  - `getUser(id)`
  - `getCaptain(id)`
  
- 📬 Refactored all listeners to use `amqplib` and keep queues **durable = false** (temporary, dev-friendly).

---

## 🌐 API Gateway Upgraded

- ✨ Added support for **WebSocket Proxying**:
  ```js
  server.on('upgrade', (req, socket, head) => {
      if (req.url.startsWith('/rides/socket.io')) {
          proxy.ws(req, socket, head, { target: 'http://localhost:3003' });
      }
  });```
🔁 Enabled /rides service to handle both REST and WebSocket traffic via http-proxy-middleware + http-proxy.

🔐 Gateway auth middleware still flows through getMiddleware.js over RabbitMQ (from Day 13).
